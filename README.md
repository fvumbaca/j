J is a lightweight journaling system for the terminal power user. It is
intended to be a quick and easy way to input and review notes and todo items.

## Who is J for?

J is for the terminal power user. Users who I believe would enjoy J typicaly
would resonate with the following statements:

- I spend most of my time on a computer in a terminal
- I use a terminal-based editor and tooling (ie Vim, Emacs, Helix, Tmux, etc)
- I like productivity tools but Electron and Web pages are heavy and slow
- I like remote dev boxes
- I care where my notes are hosted

## Install

Install with go by running:

```sh
go install github.com/fvumbaca/j@latest
```
